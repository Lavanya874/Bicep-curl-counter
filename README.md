# Bicep Curl Counter

## Overview
Bicep Curl Counter is a computer vision project that utilizes MediaPipe to analyze and count bicep curls in real-time. It provides visual feedback on arm angles during the workout and saves session data.

## Features
- Real-time bicep curl counting using computer vision
- Visual feedback on arm angles during the workout
- Saves session data including curl counts and arm angles

## Installation
To run Bicep Curl Counter, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

pip install opencv-python mediapipe pandas matplotlib

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bicep-Curl-Counter.git
   cd Bicep-Curl-Counter

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook Bicep_Curl_Counter.ipynb:
   jupyter notebook Bicep_Curl_Counter.ipynb

3. Execute the notebook cells to start the workout session and view real-time feedback.

   - The notebook will use your webcam (or camera) to capture your workout movements.
   - It will count the number of bicep curls performed by each arm.
   - Real-time feedback on arm angles will be displayed on the screen.

Results:
- Session Data: After running the notebook, session data (number of curls per arm) will be saved in workout_data.csv.
- Angle Data: The angles of your left and right arms during the workout will be saved in angles_data.csv.
